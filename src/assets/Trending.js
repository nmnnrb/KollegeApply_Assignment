            "content": "CBSE Class 12 Physics Question Paper 2024 (Set 3 - 55/2/3): A Detailed Analysis \n \n The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducted the Class 12 Physics examination for the academic year 2023-24 on March 4, 2024. As one of the most crucial subjects for students aspiring to pursue careers in engineering, medicine, and other science-related fields, the Physics exam is often regarded as a challenging test of conceptual understanding and application skills. The question paper for Set 3 (55/2/3) was designed in accordance with the latest CBSE syllabus and examination guidelines, incorporating a well-balanced mix of theory-based and numerical problems. \n \n Structure and Pattern of the Question Paper \n \n The 2024 Physics question paper followed the CBSE pattern and was divided into different sections to evaluate students' comprehension, analytical, and problem-solving abilities. The paper was structured as follows: \n \n Total Marks and Duration: The paper carried a total of 70 marks and had a duration of 3 hours (10:30 AM to 1:30 PM). Students were given 15 minutes of reading time before they could start writing. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n Question Paper Design: \n \n Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): Approximately 20% of the paper consisted of MCQs, testing students' conceptual understanding and quick decision-making skills. \n \n Competency-Based Questions: 40% of the paper was competency-based, requiring students to apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems. \n \n Short and Long Answer Questions: The remaining 40% of the paper included short and long descriptive questions, which required logical reasoning and step-by-step explanations. \n \n Section-Wise Distribution: \n \n Section A: 18 questions of 1 mark each (MCQs and assertion-reasoning based questions). \n \n Section B: 7 questions of 2 marks each. \n \n Electrostatics and Current Electricity are fundamental units in Class 12 Physics, and several questions in the paper were from these chapters. Questions included concepts related to: \n \n Gauss’s Law and its applications. \n \n Capacitance and energy stored in a capacitor. \n \n Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s laws in circuit analysis. \n \n Potentiometer and meter bridge-based numerical problems. \n \n Students found the numerical questions from this section moderate to challenging, especially those requiring circuit analysis. Concept-based MCQs were direct and easy to solve. \n \n 2. Magnetic Effects of Current and Magnetism \n \n This section included questions on: \n \n Biot-Savart Law and its application to determine the magnetic field. \n \n Ampere’s Circuital Law and its derivations. \n \n Motion of charged particles in a magnetic field. \n \n Torque on a magnetic dipole in a uniform magnetic field. \n \n While some found it manageable, others struggled with certain tricky numerical problems. A strategic approach to preparation, emphasizing numerical proficiency and conceptual clarity, is key to excelling in Physics board exams. Students who thoroughly revised all topics and practiced extensively were able to navigate the paper with ease, setting a strong foundation for their academic and career pursuits.",
